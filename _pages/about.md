Hello, my name is **Vlad**, and this year, I am proudly celebrating my **10th anniversary** in the field of software engineering. 

My **versatile experience** encompasses everything from working with international conglomerates boasting over *50,000 employees*, to more intimate, single-office environments with just *45 individuals* on the payroll.

My **project portfolio** is as diverse as my work settings. I've had the privilege of contributing to high-impact *enterprise web development* applications and engaging in the creative world of *(hyper-)casual game development*. I've been instrumental in both outsourcing environments and product companies, demonstrating adaptability in different business models.

In terms of **project stages**, my experience is well-rounded. I've delved into *large, complex legacy systems* requiring intricate understanding and meticulous handling. I've also had the honor of delivering *greenfield projects* to release from scratch, marking them with my innovative footprint.

My **roles within teams** have been equally multifaceted, ranging from being an integral part of *larger teams*, to operating as an *independent key developer*, and also *managing and leading* my own teams of engineers. Be it in a globally networked online context or an intimate office setting, my ability to deliver and drive results remains unwavering.

What does this mean for your business? Simply put, I'm equipped to **smooth out your development operations**, regardless of your business type, project complexity, team structure, or operational model. I am here to help you navigate the ever-evolving landscape of software development with confidence and efficiency. Let's talk about how we can work together to achieve your goals.
